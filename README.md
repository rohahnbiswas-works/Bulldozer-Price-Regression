# Bulldozer-Price-Regression
This ML regression model was created by me as a part of learning Machine Learning. This model utilizes several concepts of regression supervised learning and utilizes schikit-learn library. This model trains on a bulldozer prices related dataset and creates a regression equation to predict bulldozer prices based on various features  etc. Various Concepts like data preprocessing, hyperparameter tuning, evaluation techniques of regression (like Mean Squared Error and Root Mean Squared Logaraithmic Error) were learnt and utilized in this project.
